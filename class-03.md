### HTML Lists

- There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:

    - __Ordered lists__ are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

    - __Unordered lists__ are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).

    - __Definition lists__ are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

- Lists can be nested inside one another

### Boxes

- You can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:
    - Control the dimensions of your boxes
    - Create borders around boxes
    - Set margins and padding for boxes
    - Show and hide boxes

- CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it has its own box.

- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

- You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.

- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.

- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

### Arrays

- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

- Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold.

- If you don't know how many items a list will contain, rather than creating enough variables for a long list (when you might only use a small percentage of them), using an array is considered a better solution.

- You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array).

- The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.

- This technique for creating an array is known as an array literal. It is usually the preferred method for creating an array. You can also write each value on a separate line: EXample colors= ['white','black','custom'];

- Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

- To access a value from an array, after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets.

### Decisions and loops

- A __switch statement__ starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

- If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sense of the operation rather than report an error.

- Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false

- Because of type coercion, the strict equality operators ===and ! == result in fewer unexpected values than ==and ! = do.

- *Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result* - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se).
