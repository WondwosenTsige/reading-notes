### Images

- There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

- A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

- Images should...
    - Be relevant
    - Convey information
    - Convey the right mood
    - Be instantly recognisable
    - Fit the color palette

- The <img> element is used to add images to a web page

- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.

- You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

- __Photographs__ *are best saved as JPEGs;* __illustrations or logos__ *that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.*


### Color

- Color can really bring your pages to life.

- The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

    - __rgb values__: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

    - __hex codes__: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
    
    - __color names__:  There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

### Text

- The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

    - Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)

    - Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)

- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
