### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.

- many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as _‘‘employee performance optimization’_’ — isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based.

- Studies show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more

- Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.

- Google’s Aristotle research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group

- For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.

- There was nothing in Project Aristotle’s research that said that getting people to open up about their struggles was critical to discussing a group’s norms.

- **The behaviors that create psychological safety  conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.**
