### HTML text

- When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

    - __Structural markup:__ the elements that you can use to describe both *headings and paragraphs*
    - __Semantic markup:__ which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on

- HTML has six "levels" of __headings__ from <h1> to <h6> and <h1> is used for main headings

- To create a __paragraph__, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.

- By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.

- By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.

- The __sup__ element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 2<sup>2</sup>.

- The __sub__ element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H<sub>2</sub>0.

- In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines. When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as <b>white space collapsing</b>.

- If you wanted <i>to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph</i> you can use the line break tag <br />.

- <i>To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play</i> — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the <hr /> tag.

- There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are known as __empty elements__ and they are written differently.
